1. WAP in C to implement FCFS CPU Scheduling Algo.
	a. Without Arrival Time
	b. With  Different Arrival Time of each process
Note: Number of Process, Arrival time of each process, and Burst time of each process will be given by user. You can use structure or array to implement FCFS Algorithm.

2. WAP in C to implement SJF, SRTF, Round-Robin and Non-preemptive priority CPU scheduling.
	a. With diff Arrival Time of each process.
Note: Priority is to be given by user. Lower number is higher priority.
